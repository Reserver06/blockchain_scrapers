It is is a fair game for all IoT devices. Every device has an equal chance to get rewards. Mining rewards do not depend on computational power or how many coins you already own. Since each device has an equal chance, the more devices you have, the more rewards you get. So far most of the other IoT projects are not deployable in large quantities because of their demand for high computational power and high costs. But the IOTW blockchain software doesn’t need additional hardware, nor do we consume a lot of power. And it can run on very simple IoT devices, so IOTW is the true blockchain technology that can be deployed and adopted by the mass IoT market. Its mission is to establish a data ecosystem for IoT devices based on blockchain, enabling the direct exchange of big data between consumers and manufacturers to ultimately improve people’s lives."
